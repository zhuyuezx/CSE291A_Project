============================================================
SYSTEM: MCTS Heuristic Improvement
============================================================
You are an expert game-playing AI researcher.
Your task is to improve a specific MCTS heuristic function
for the game 'sokoban_macro' (phase: selection).

PHASE: selection
  • What it does: Walks down the tree from root to a leaf. Chooses which existing branch to explore next. Must balance exploration (UCB) and exploitation.
  • Optimization goal: Improve how we RANK existing nodes — favor promising branches, deprioritize dead ends. Your heuristic adjusts node scores used by UCB1.
  • Constraints: Called very often. Keep it CHEAP — no multi-step rollouts, no deep deadlock simulation. Rank nodes, don't simulate.
  • Good patterns: bonus for more boxes on targets, bonus for lower box distance, penalize obvious deadlocks, novelty bonus for under-visited nodes.
  • Avoid: expensive rollout logic, final reward shaping (that belongs in simulation).

APPROACH — 70 / 30 RULE:
  ~70% of iterations: INCREMENTAL OPTIMIZATION
    • Start from the CURRENT code.
    • Make targeted, gradual improvements (add a check,
      tweak weights, add a heuristic factor, etc.).
    • Prefer building on what works rather than replacing it.

  ~30% of iterations: PARADIGM SHIFT (when warranted)
    • If the current approach is fundamentally flawed or
      plateauing, you may propose a larger restructure.
    • Explain clearly WHY a rewrite is needed.
    • Even rewrites should keep proven components that work.

GENERAL RULES:
  • Write clean, well-structured code — as long as the
    heuristic needs to be (no artificial line limit).
  • Each iteration builds on the previous version.
  • Complex heuristics with multiple factors are encouraged
    when they improve play quality.

GAME RULES
------------------------------------------------------------
Game: Sokoban (Macro-Push Variant)

== Overview ==
Sokoban is a single-player puzzle game. The player pushes boxes onto
target positions inside a grid-based warehouse. This variant uses
MACRO-PUSH actions: instead of single-step movement (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT),
each action represents a complete box push from any position the player
can walk to in the current state.

== Symbols ==
  #   wall (impassable)
  .   target position
  $   box
  *   box on a target
  @   player
  +   player standing on a target
  (space)  empty floor

== Rules ==
1. The player's reachable region is all floor cells connected to the
   player's current position by paths not blocked by walls or boxes
   (computed via BFS flood-fill).
2. An action is a (player_pos, direction) tuple where:
   - player_pos is a cell in the reachable region
   - direction is UP(0), DOWN(1), LEFT(2), or RIGHT(3)
   - The cell at player_pos + delta(direction) must contain a box
   - The cell at player_pos + 2*delta(direction) must be free
3. Applying an action:
   a. The player walks from current position to player_pos via BFS
      shortest path (costs len(path) steps).
   b. The player pushes the box one cell in the push direction
      (costs 1 step). Player ends at the box's original position.
4. Total step cost per action = walk_steps + 1.
5. The action space varies per state — different states may have
   different numbers of available pushes.
6. The puzzle is solved when ALL boxes are on target positions.
7. A game is lost when a box is in deadlock (e.g., corner not on target),
   or when max_steps is reached.

== Actions ==
The action space is a list of (player_pos, direction) tuples.
  player_pos = (row, col) — where the player must stand to push
  direction = 0(UP), 1(DOWN), 2(LEFT), 3(RIGHT) — push direction

Example: ((2, 3), 1) means "walk to (2,3) then push DOWN" — the box
at (3,3) moves to (4,3), player ends at (3,3).

== State Representation ==
Each state is described by:
  - The player's (row, col) position.
  - The set of (row, col) positions of all boxes.
  - A step counter (game terminates if max_steps is reached).
  - Derived metrics: boxes_on_targets count and total_box_distance
    (sum of Manhattan distance from each box to its nearest target).

== Reward ==
  - Solved (all boxes on targets): 1.0
  - Deadlocked or max_steps: 0.0

== GameState API ==
Public attributes (via properties):
  walls     : frozenset[tuple[int,int]]   – wall positions
  targets   : frozenset[tuple[int,int]]   – target positions
  boxes     : set[tuple[int,int]]         – current box positions
  player    : tuple[int,int]              – current player position
  height, width : int                     – grid dimensions
  num_targets   : int                     – number of targets
  steps, max_steps : int                  – current / maximum step count

Public methods:
  clone()            → new independent copy of the state
  legal_actions()    → list[tuple[tuple[int,int], int]]  (macro-push tuples)
  apply_action(a)    → None (mutates the state in-place)
  is_terminal()      → bool
  returns()          → list[float]
  current_player()   → int (always 0)
  state_key()        → str (hashable key for transposition)
  boxes_on_targets() → int
  total_box_distance() → int

== Key Strategic Concepts ==
  - Every action is a box push — think about WHICH box to push and
    from WHERE, not about walking directions.
  - Avoid pushes that create deadlocks (box in non-target corner,
    box against wall with no reachable target).
  - Plan push ORDER: placing one box may block paths needed for others.
  - Consider the cost of walking: a push requiring a long walk costs
    more steps than a nearby push.
  - Minimize total push count; fewer pushes usually means fewer
    opportunities for deadlock.

Per-level best composites so far:

the current approach is fundamentally flawed, a larger restructure
is acceptable.

------------------------------------------------------------
PRIOR ANALYSIS (from step 1)
------------------------------------------------------------
Below is the analysis identifying weaknesses and a proposed
approach (incremental or restructure). Implement the proposed
changes faithfully — stay aligned with the analysis.

**1. KEY WEAKNESSES**  

| # | Observation (from the trace) | Why it hurts performance |
|---|------------------------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | The same macro‑pushes are revisited thousands of times (e.g., `((2,4),2)` appears with v≈500 in many successive moves). | The selection routine keeps descending the same low‑f branch, never giving a chance to explore alternative pushes that might break the dead‑end. |
| 2 | The tree‑walk ignores the `exploration_weight` argument completely. | No UCB‑style term → pure greedy A* (min g + h). When several children share an identical f‑score the tie‑breaker (`fewest visits`) is too weak; the algorithm falls into depth‑first “tunnel” behaviour. |
| 3 | `g` is the pure node depth, not the accumulated **real** cost (walk + push). | A cheap‑looking shallow node may hide a huge walk cost, so the algorithm prefers pushes that look close in depth but actually waste many steps, stalling progress toward the goal. |
| 4 | `h_sokoban` is a static Manhattan‑distance heuristic; it does **not** penalise obvious dead‑locks (corner, wall‑line) or reward a box landing on a target. | The f‑value does not distinguish a push that creates a dead‑lock from one that makes progress, so the greedy descent often walks into dead‑ends (see moves 9–12 where a box is placed on a target but the algorithm keeps wobbling around it). |
| 5 | No novelty/visit‑bonus beyond the simple “fewest visits” tie‑break. | Nodes that have been visited many times still receive the same f, so the algorithm spends many iterations on an already‑exhausted branch. |

The combined effect is **excessive exploitation of a single cheap‑looking line**, leading to a long but unproductive search (76 steps, only 1/2 boxes placed, return 0).

---

**2. ROOT CAUSE**  

The selection code implements a pure best‑first walk:

```python
g = _ag.node_depth(child)          # depth only
h = _ag.h_sokoban(child.state)     # static distance heuristic
f = g + h
```

*No exploration term* (`exploration_weight` is never used).  
*Depth* is not the true accumulated cost, so `f` does not reflect the macro‑push cost.  
`h_sokoban` lacks dead‑lock penalties and target‑placement bonuses, so f‐values of dead‑ended and promising children can be identical, making the tie‑breaker (`fewest visits`) insufficient. Consequently the algorithm repeatedly selects the same child, inflating its visit count while never opening alternative branches.

---

**3. PROPOSED APPROACH**  

**Strategy A – Incremental improvement (≈70 % of effort).**  
We keep the overall A*‑guided framework (it already provides a useful heuristic backbone) but augment it with three lightweight, high‑impact tweaks:

1. **Add an explicit exploration component** to the score, preserving the supplied `exploration_weight`.  
   - Compute `explore = exploration_weight * sqrt(log(parent.visits) / child.visits)` (or the classic UCB term).  
   - New score: `f = g + h - explore` (lower is better).  
   This restores a balanced trade‑off without discarding the A* intuition.

2. **Replace pure depth with the real accumulated step cost** (`child.state.steps` or the macro‑push cost).  
   - `g = child.state.steps` (or the stored `g` from the shared A* table).  
   - This makes `f` penalise long walks, steering the search toward pushes that actually advance the solution.

3. **Enrich the heuristic `h` locally** (still cheap, no extra roll‑outs).  
   - Pull the dead‑lock detection already used in expansion/simulation (`is_deadlocked`) and add a small penalty (`+ deadlock_penalty`) when `h_sokoban` would otherwise be identical.  
   - Add a tiny **target‑placement bonus** (`‑ target_bonus` if a push puts a box on a target).  
   - Both constants can be tiny (e.g., 0.1) just enough to break ties in favour of progress.

The modified loop would still iterate over children, compute `g`, `h`, `explore`, and select the child with the smallest `f`. Tie‑breaking can stay “fewest visits” as a secondary fallback.

These three changes are O(1) per child, keep the code simple, and directly address the highest‑impact weaknesses: lack of exploration, inaccurate cost estimation, and indistinguishable dead‑ends. No restructuring of the whole MCTS pipeline is required, and the existing A* globals remain usable.

*Why not a full restructure?*  
A complete switch back to classic UCB1 would discard the valuable domain‑specific distance heuristic already proven useful in other levels (selection performed perfectly on level 3). The problem is not the idea of A*‑guided selection but its overly greedy instantiation; an incremental fix restores exploration while preserving the beneficial distance bias.

------------------------------------------------------------
TASK — IMPROVE THE HEURISTIC
------------------------------------------------------------
Improve the 'selection' function above based on your
analysis. Decide which approach fits best:

OPTION A — Incremental optimization (~70% of the time):
  Start from the CURRENT code and make targeted improvements.
  Examples:
  • Add a deadlock check (box in corner with no target)
  • Add distance-based scoring factors
  • Switch from random rollout to greedy lookahead
  • Add early-termination for stuck states
  • Tune weights or scoring formula
  • Combine multiple heuristic signals

OPTION B — Paradigm shift (~30% of the time):
  If the current approach is fundamentally limited, propose
  a different strategy. Keep any components that work well.
  State clearly in DESCRIPTION why a restructure is needed.

How the 'selection' phase works in MCTS:
  - Receives (root, exploration_weight). Returns the chosen child index.
  - Adjusts UCB scores or selection policy to favor promising branches.
  - Called at every level during tree descent — keep it FAST.
  - Must produce a valid child index; selection drives which branch gets expanded next.

CONSTRAINTS:
  • Same function signature as the current code.
  • Standalone function, standard library only.
  • SELF-CONTAINED: define ALL helper functions inline.
    Do NOT use undefined names (e.g. _ag, _bfs_distance).
  • node is MCTSNode (uses __slots__). Use ONLY node.state,
    node.parent, node.children, node._untried_actions,
    node.visits, node.value. Do NOT assign new attributes.
  • Code can be as long as the heuristic requires — no
    artificial line limit. Prioritize quality over brevity.

You MUST format your response EXACTLY as follows:

ACTION: modify
FILE_NAME: <filename>.py
FUNCTION_NAME: <entry_point_function_name>
DESCRIPTION: <one-line: what you changed and why>
```python
<your complete function code here>
```

Rules for the header fields:
- ACTION must be either 'create' (brand new tool) or 'modify'
  (improving the existing tool shown above).
- FILE_NAME must end in .py and contain only [a-z0-9_].
- FUNCTION_NAME must match the main function defined in the code.
- The code block must be valid Python that can run standalone.

---

## Response

ACTION: modify
FILE_NAME: selection.py
FUNCTION_NAME: default_selection
DESCRIPTION: Added exploration term, used real step cost as g, and enriched h with dead‑lock penalties and target‑placement bonuses to break ties and avoid greedy dead‑ends.
```python
"""
A*-guided MCTS selection with exploration and richer heuristic.

Improvements:
  • Uses the actual accumulated step cost (state.steps) as g instead of
    pure tree depth.
  • Adds a UCB‑style exploration term (weighted by exploration_weight)
    to avoid over‑exploitation of a single low‑f branch.
  • Enriches the heuristic h with a small dead‑lock penalty and a bonus
    for pushes that increase the number of boxes on targets.
  • Keeps the original A*‑style best‑first walk and root‑search reset.
