============================================================
SYSTEM: MCTS Heuristic Improvement
============================================================
You are an expert game-playing AI researcher.
Your task is to improve a specific MCTS heuristic function
for the game 'sokoban_macro' (phase: expansion).

PHASE: expansion
  • What it does: Creates new child nodes from a frontier node. Decides which actions to materialize into the tree and in what order.
  • Optimization goal: PRUNE bad actions and ORDER remaining actions so promising ones are tried first. Filter deadlocks before they enter the tree.
  • Constraints: Best place for hard constraints. Order actions; optionally filter some entirely. No rollout policies or value aggregation.
  • Good patterns: reject pushes into non-target corners, reject wall deadlocks, prefer pushes that reduce box distance, deprioritize no-op player movement.
  • Avoid: long rollout policies, reward aggregation, node-value update rules.

APPROACH — 70 / 30 RULE:
  ~70% of iterations: INCREMENTAL OPTIMIZATION
    • Start from the CURRENT code.
    • Make targeted, gradual improvements (add a check,
      tweak weights, add a heuristic factor, etc.).
    • Prefer building on what works rather than replacing it.

  ~30% of iterations: PARADIGM SHIFT (when warranted)
    • If the current approach is fundamentally flawed or
      plateauing, you may propose a larger restructure.
    • Explain clearly WHY a rewrite is needed.
    • Even rewrites should keep proven components that work.

GENERAL RULES:
  • Write clean, well-structured code — as long as the
    heuristic needs to be (no artificial line limit).
  • Each iteration builds on the previous version.
  • Complex heuristics with multiple factors are encouraged
    when they improve play quality.

GAME RULES
------------------------------------------------------------
Game: Sokoban (Macro-Push Variant)

== Overview ==
Sokoban is a single-player puzzle game. The player pushes boxes onto
target positions inside a grid-based warehouse. This variant uses
MACRO-PUSH actions: instead of single-step movement (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT),
each action represents a complete box push from any position the player
can walk to in the current state.

== Symbols ==
  #   wall (impassable)
  .   target position
  $   box
  *   box on a target
  @   player
  +   player standing on a target
  (space)  empty floor

== Rules ==
1. The player's reachable region is all floor cells connected to the
   player's current position by paths not blocked by walls or boxes
   (computed via BFS flood-fill).
2. An action is a (player_pos, direction) tuple where:
   - player_pos is a cell in the reachable region
   - direction is UP(0), DOWN(1), LEFT(2), or RIGHT(3)
   - The cell at player_pos + delta(direction) must contain a box
   - The cell at player_pos + 2*delta(direction) must be free
3. Applying an action:
   a. The player walks from current position to player_pos via BFS
      shortest path (costs len(path) steps).
   b. The player pushes the box one cell in the push direction
      (costs 1 step). Player ends at the box's original position.
4. Total step cost per action = walk_steps + 1.
5. The action space varies per state — different states may have
   different numbers of available pushes.
6. The puzzle is solved when ALL boxes are on target positions.
7. A game is lost when a box is in deadlock (e.g., corner not on target),
   or when max_steps is reached.

== Actions ==
The action space is a list of (player_pos, direction) tuples.
  player_pos = (row, col) — where the player must stand to push
  direction = 0(UP), 1(DOWN), 2(LEFT), 3(RIGHT) — push direction

Example: ((2, 3), 1) means "walk to (2,3) then push DOWN" — the box
at (3,3) moves to (4,3), player ends at (3,3).

== State Representation ==
Each state is described by:
  - The player's (row, col) position.
  - The set of (row, col) positions of all boxes.
  - A step counter (game terminates if max_steps is reached).
  - Derived metrics: boxes_on_targets count and total_box_distance
    (sum of Manhattan distance from each box to its nearest target).

== Reward ==
  - Solved (all boxes on targets): 1.0
  - Deadlocked or max_steps: 0.0

== GameState API ==
Public attributes (via properties):
  walls     : frozenset[tuple[int,int]]   – wall positions
  targets   : frozenset[tuple[int,int]]   – target positions
  boxes     : set[tuple[int,int]]         – current box positions
  player    : tuple[int,int]              – current player position
  height, width : int                     – grid dimensions
  num_targets   : int                     – number of targets
  steps, max_steps : int                  – current / maximum step count

Public methods:
  clone()            → new independent copy of the state
  legal_actions()    → list[tuple[tuple[int,int], int]]  (macro-push tuples)
  apply_action(a)    → None (mutates the state in-place)
  is_terminal()      → bool
  returns()          → list[float]
  current_player()   → int (always 0)
  state_key()        → str (hashable key for transposition)
  boxes_on_targets() → int
  total_box_distance() → int

== Key Strategic Concepts ==
  - Every action is a box push — think about WHICH box to push and
    from WHERE, not about walking directions.
  - Avoid pushes that create deadlocks (box in non-target corner,
    box against wall with no reachable target).
  - Plan push ORDER: placing one box may block paths needed for others.
  - Consider the cost of walking: a push requiring a long walk costs
    more steps than a nearby push.
  - Minimize total push count; fewer pushes usually means fewer
    opportunities for deadlock.

------------------------------------------------------------
PRIOR ANALYSIS (from step 1)
------------------------------------------------------------
Below is the analysis identifying weaknesses and a proposed
approach (incremental or restructure). Implement the proposed
changes faithfully — stay aligned with the analysis.

**1. Key Weaknesses**  

| Rank | Symptom (trace evidence) | Why it hurts |
|------|--------------------------|--------------|
| **1️⃣** | The same macro‑push `((2,4),2)` dominates the tree (e.g. moves 4, 8, 13, 15, 17, 19). Its child node receives **500 visits** while every other action gets **≤ 1**. The search never explores alternatives that could finish the second box. | Expansion picks a *single* best‑scoring action and discards all others for that node. When the heuristic produces identical (or almost identical) scores, the first‑seen action is repeatedly chosen, leading to a **narrow, depth‑first** search. |
| **2️⃣** | No progress after step 73 – total box‑Manhattan distance is 1, one box on target, but the algorithm keeps cycling pushes that keep the sum distance unchanged (e.g. moves 14 → 16 → 18). | The heuristic scores **`new_box_dist + ALPHA*walk_len`** when `delta = 0` and `on_target = 0`. Many pushes (moving a box left then right) leave the summed distance unchanged, so they are considered equally good. The algorithm therefore does not recognise that it is *undoing* previous work. |
| **3️⃣** | Dead‑lock detection catches only corner and wall‑line cases. On level 6 the solution stalls with one box one step from a target, yet the algorithm keeps pushing the *other* box around the same space. | The current dead‑lock test never flags “temporary” blockages such as **pushing a box away from a target while another box blocks the path**. Consequently the tree expands states that are harmless in the short term but dead‑end in the long term. |
| **4️⃣** | No incentive to diversify actions. The heuristic never includes a term that rewards **low‑visit** actions, so the tree quickly collapses onto the first high‑scoring move. | MCTS normally relies on the selection phase (UCB) for exploration. Here selection is A*‑guided and does **not** use a visit‑based bonus, so exploration must come from expansion. With a deterministic scoring function the tree becomes *greedy*. |

**2. Root Cause**  

*The expansion routine is deterministic and overly greedy.*  
- It computes a scalar `h` and **always expands the lowest‑h action**, removing it from `_untried_actions`.  
- When many actions share the same `h` (common because `new_box_dist` and `walk_len` are often equal), the first action in the list wins every time.  
- The visited‑pruning map only blocks **identical states with a higher or equal g‑value**; it does **not** prevent revisiting the *same* state reached via a higher‑cost path, so the algorithm can loop around the same configuration with increasing step count.  
- The heuristic does not penalize pushes that keep the global distance unchanged but move a *different* box farther away, nor does it favour actions that have been tried rarely.

These design choices make the tree **deep but narrow**, which is why the search stalls at a distance‑1 dead‑end on level 6.

**3. Proposed Approach – Strategy A (incremental)**  

We can keep the existing scaffold (node creation, visited map, dead‑lock checks) and add three lightweight improvements that directly attack the weaknesses above.

| Modification | Rationale & Expected Effect |
|--------------|------------------------------|
| **a. Tie‑breaker noise / visit‑penalty**<br> `h ← h – ε * log(1 + child_visits)` (ε ≈ 0.01) | Gives a tiny advantage to actions that have been visited less often, breaking deterministic ties and forcing the tree to sample alternative pushes. |
| **b. Per‑box delta penalty**<br> Compute `delta_i = max(0, new_dist_i – old_dist_i)` for each box; set `delta = sum(delta_i)` (instead of only the total increase). | A push that moves *any* box away from its closest target now incurs a penalty, preventing the algorithm from undoing progress (e.g., moving a box left/right while the other stays). |
| **c. Stronger target‑placement reward**<br> Increase `GAMMA` (e.g. 1.2) **and** add a bonus for *reducing the distance of the farthest box* (`far_bonus = λ * (old_farthest – new_farthest)`, λ ≈ 0.5). | Pushes that bring a box onto a target or that substantially shrink the longest remaining Manhattan distance become clearly preferable, steering the search toward the missing box instead of shuffling the already‑placed one. |
| **d. Simple “recent‑box” penalty** (optional but cheap). Keep a per‑node attribute `last_moved_box`; if the current action moves the same box as `last_moved_box`, add `ρ` (≈0.2) to `h`. | Discourages immediate back‑and‑forth pushes of the same box, reducing the observed cycling of `((2,4),2)`. |

All four tweaks are **constant‑time** per action and fit naturally into the existing loop that builds the `scored` list. They preserve the current dead‑lock filters, visited pruning, and child‑creation logic, so no other part of the engine needs to change.

**Why incremental, not a rewrite?**  
The expansion phase already provides a solid framework (BFS walk length, dead‑lock checks, per‑root visited map). The failure stems from a **lack of discrimination** between equally‑scored actions, not from a fundamentally wrong design. Adding the small stochastic / visit‑based term and a more expressive distance‑change penalty yields a richer ordering while keeping the proven components (BFS, dead‑lock detection, g‑pruning). This aligns with the 70 % incremental rule and should immediately diversify the search, allowing the solver to examine the alternative pushes that actually place the second box on its target and thus raise the solve rate on level 6.

TASK — CRITIQUE & FINALIZE
------------------------------------------------------------
Review the DRAFT code above for critical issues.

Check for:
  1. BUGS — API misuse, crashes, wrong variable names
  2. SPEED — unnecessary clones or deep loops (runs 1000s of times)
  3. REWARD SPREAD — does the return value vary across states?

RULES:
  - Preserve the INTENT of the draft (incremental fix or
    restructure). Do NOT add unrelated features.
  - Fix bugs and performance issues. Improve clarity.
  - If the draft is correct and fast, output it UNCHANGED.

You MUST format your response EXACTLY as follows:

CRITIQUE:
<1-3 bullet points, or 'No issues found'>

ACTION: modify
FILE_NAME: <filename>.py
FUNCTION_NAME: <entry_point_function_name>
DESCRIPTION: <one-line summary>
```python
<complete final function code>
```

Rules for the header fields:
- ACTION must be either 'create' or 'modify'.
- FILE_NAME must end in .py and contain only [a-z0-9_].
- FUNCTION_NAME must match the main function defined in the code.
- The code block must be valid Python that can run standalone.

---

## Response

CRITIQUE:
- No functional bugs identified; the heuristic correctly integrates the proposed diversification and distance penalties.
- Performance is acceptable: BFS and per‑box distance calculations are necessary for each untried action and are already present in the prior version.
- The heuristic score varies across states due to walk length, distance changes, target placement, farthest‑box bonus, recent‑box penalty, and a small tie‑breaker, ensuring a spread of return values.

ACTION: modify
FILE_NAME: sokoban_macro_expansion.py
FUNCTION_NAME: default_expansion
DESCRIPTION: No functional changes needed; retain the incremental improvements as‑is.
```python
def default_expansion(node):
    """
    Expanded heuristic for macro‑push actions with additional
    diversification and finer‑grained distance penalties.

    New features:
      * Tie‑breaker noise / visit‑penalty to break deterministic ties.
      * Per‑box distance‑increase penalty (instead of only total increase).
      * Bonus / penalty based on the farthest box distance change.
      * Stronger reward for placing a box on a target.
      * Small penalty for moving the same box as the previous action
        (discourages immediate back‑and‑forth pushes).
      * Retains existing dead‑lock detection, walk‑cost weighting,
        and per‑root visited‑state pruning.
