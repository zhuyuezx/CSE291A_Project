============================================================
SYSTEM: MCTS Heuristic Improvement
============================================================
You are an expert game-playing AI researcher.
Your task is to improve a specific MCTS heuristic function
for the game 'sokoban_macro' (phase: backpropagation).

PHASE: backpropagation
  • What it does: Sends the simulation result back up the visited path. Updates node statistics (visits, value) that selection's UCB1 uses.
  • Optimization goal: Control HOW strongly rollout evidence affects node values. Calibrate depth discount, solved vs partial progress, path length.
  • Constraints: Only aggregates evidence — no move generation, no deadlock pruning, no rollout policy. Must stay coherent with selection's expectations.
  • Good patterns: depth discount so shorter plans dominate, weight solved outcomes above partial progress, reduce credit for noisy weak rollouts.
  • Avoid: move generation, deadlock pruning, rollout action-choice policy.

APPROACH — 70 / 30 RULE:
  ~70% of iterations: INCREMENTAL OPTIMIZATION
    • Start from the CURRENT code.
    • Make targeted, gradual improvements (add a check,
      tweak weights, add a heuristic factor, etc.).
    • Prefer building on what works rather than replacing it.

  ~30% of iterations: PARADIGM SHIFT (when warranted)
    • If the current approach is fundamentally flawed or
      plateauing, you may propose a larger restructure.
    • Explain clearly WHY a rewrite is needed.
    • Even rewrites should keep proven components that work.

GENERAL RULES:
  • Write clean, well-structured code — as long as the
    heuristic needs to be (no artificial line limit).
  • Each iteration builds on the previous version.
  • Complex heuristics with multiple factors are encouraged
    when they improve play quality.

GAME RULES
------------------------------------------------------------
Game: Sokoban (Macro-Push Variant)

== Overview ==
Sokoban is a single-player puzzle game. The player pushes boxes onto
target positions inside a grid-based warehouse. This variant uses
MACRO-PUSH actions: instead of single-step movement (UP/DOWN/LEFT/RIGHT),
each action represents a complete box push from any position the player
can walk to in the current state.

== Symbols ==
  #   wall (impassable)
  .   target position
  $   box
  *   box on a target
  @   player
  +   player standing on a target
  (space)  empty floor

== Rules ==
1. The player's reachable region is all floor cells connected to the
   player's current position by paths not blocked by walls or boxes
   (computed via BFS flood-fill).
2. An action is a (player_pos, direction) tuple where:
   - player_pos is a cell in the reachable region
   - direction is UP(0), DOWN(1), LEFT(2), or RIGHT(3)
   - The cell at player_pos + delta(direction) must contain a box
   - The cell at player_pos + 2*delta(direction) must be free
3. Applying an action:
   a. The player walks from current position to player_pos via BFS
      shortest path (costs len(path) steps).
   b. The player pushes the box one cell in the push direction
      (costs 1 step). Player ends at the box's original position.
4. Total step cost per action = walk_steps + 1.
5. The action space varies per state — different states may have
   different numbers of available pushes.
6. The puzzle is solved when ALL boxes are on target positions.
7. A game is lost when a box is in deadlock (e.g., corner not on target),
   or when max_steps is reached.

== Actions ==
The action space is a list of (player_pos, direction) tuples.
  player_pos = (row, col) — where the player must stand to push
  direction = 0(UP), 1(DOWN), 2(LEFT), 3(RIGHT) — push direction

Example: ((2, 3), 1) means "walk to (2,3) then push DOWN" — the box
at (3,3) moves to (4,3), player ends at (3,3).

== State Representation ==
Each state is described by:
  - The player's (row, col) position.
  - The set of (row, col) positions of all boxes.
  - A step counter (game terminates if max_steps is reached).
  - Derived metrics: boxes_on_targets count and total_box_distance
    (sum of Manhattan distance from each box to its nearest target).

== Reward ==
  - Solved (all boxes on targets): 1.0
  - Deadlocked or max_steps: 0.0

== GameState API ==
Public attributes (via properties):
  walls     : frozenset[tuple[int,int]]   – wall positions
  targets   : frozenset[tuple[int,int]]   – target positions
  boxes     : set[tuple[int,int]]         – current box positions
  player    : tuple[int,int]              – current player position
  height, width : int                     – grid dimensions
  num_targets   : int                     – number of targets
  steps, max_steps : int                  – current / maximum step count

Public methods:
  clone()            → new independent copy of the state
  legal_actions()    → list[tuple[tuple[int,int], int]]  (macro-push tuples)
  apply_action(a)    → None (mutates the state in-place)
  is_terminal()      → bool
  returns()          → list[float]
  current_player()   → int (always 0)
  state_key()        → str (hashable key for transposition)
  boxes_on_targets() → int
  total_box_distance() → int

== Key Strategic Concepts ==
  - Every action is a box push — think about WHICH box to push and
    from WHERE, not about walking directions.
  - Avoid pushes that create deadlocks (box in non-target corner,
    box against wall with no reachable target).
  - Plan push ORDER: placing one box may block paths needed for others.
  - Consider the cost of walking: a push requiring a long walk costs
    more steps than a nearby push.
  - Minimize total push count; fewer pushes usually means fewer
    opportunities for deadlock.

------------------------------------------------------------
PRIOR ANALYSIS (from step 1)
------------------------------------------------------------
Below is the analysis identifying weaknesses and a proposed
approach (incremental or restructure). Implement the proposed
changes faithfully — stay aligned with the analysis.

**1. KEY WEAKNESSES**

| # | Symptom (from Trace #1) | Why it hurts |
|---|--------------------------|--------------|
| 1️⃣| All child nodes quickly converge to **≈ 0.44 average value** despite very different progress (0 / 4 vs 2 / 4 boxes). | The back‑propagation reward that reaches the ancestors is almost vanished, so the value field no longer reflects how far the leaf is from a solution. |
| 2️⃣| Depth ≈ 14 (six macro‑pushes, many walk steps) yet **γ = 0.70** gives a discount of 0.70¹⁴ ≈ 0.007. Together with the step‑penalty the leaf reward becomes *≈ 0.001* before it is added to the parent. | Deep but promising branches receive almost no credit; the tree keeps expanding shallow “cheap” pushes that never solve the puzzle. |
| 3️⃣| **SOLVED_BONUS = 0.50** is added *before* the depth discount. For a solved leaf at depth ≥ 10 the discounted contribution is < 0.01, so solved nodes never dominate the selection tie‑break. | The algorithm cannot recognise a full solution as “high‑value”, so it rarely selects the final push that completes the level. |
| 4️⃣| **STEP_PENALTY = 0.01** multiplies the total step counter (≈ 15 steps) → ≈ 0.15 subtraction from a simulation reward that is already ≤ 1.0. Combined with the depth discount the reward often collapses to zero. | Over‑penalising walk cost masks any useful signal from the simulation, especially in macro‑push domains where a single push can cost many walk steps. |

The dominant issue is **over‑aggressive attenuation of the leaf reward**, which renders the value field almost noise‑like. Consequently the A*‑guided selection has little to work with and oscillates among high‑visit but low‑information nodes, never committing to the longer sequences needed to place the remaining two boxes.

**2. ROOT CAUSE**

The back‑propagation routine applies an **absolute depth discount**:

```python
discounted_reward = (GAMMA ** cur_depth) * base_reward
```

* γ = 0.70 is far below what typical MCTS uses (≈ 0.95‑0.99).  
* Discount is based on *cur_depth* (from root) instead of the distance to the leaf, so ancestors deeper than a few plies receive near‑zero updates.  
* The solved‑bonus and step‑penalty are applied *before* the discount, so they are also shrunk dramatically.  

Together these choices turn the back‑propagated values into ≈ 0 for any leaf beyond depth ≈ 6, exactly where the trace shows the algorithm gets stuck. The code is otherwise correct (it updates visits, value, and the shared `visited` map), but the *scaling* of the reward is unsuitable for Sokoban‑Macro where useful plans are inherently deep.

**3. PROPOSED APPROACH – Strategy A (Incremental)**  

We can restore a meaningful value signal with three small, orthogonal tweaks:

1. **Use leaf‑relative discount** – propagate the same *leaf* reward to all ancestors, scaling only by the *remaining* depth to the leaf:

   ```python
   remaining = leaf_depth - cur_depth
   discounted = (GAMMA ** remaining) * base_reward
   ```

   This lets the root receive a sizable fraction of the leaf’s reward while still favouring shallower nodes.

2. **Raise γ to a less aggressive value** (e.g., **0.95**). With leaf‑relative discount the exponent never exceeds the leaf‑depth, so a γ of 0.95 still provides a smooth decay without annihilating the signal.

3. **Tone down the step‑penalty and solved‑bonus handling**:
   * Reduce `STEP_PENALTY` to **0.001** (or remove it entirely) because walk‑step cost is already reflected in the simulation’s shaped reward.
   * Add the solved‑bonus **after** discounting (or simply set `SOLVED_BONUS = 1.0` and apply it to the discounted reward) so a solved leaf yields a bright spike at the root, guaranteeing that the final push is unmistakably the best move.

These three changes keep the existing API, the per‑root `visited` synchronization, and the additive update logic untouched. They merely adjust *how* the reward is scaled, directly addressing the dominant weakness (excessive attenuation) while preserving the proven expansion, simulation, and A*‑guided selection components.

**Why not a full restructure?**  
The rest of the pipeline (selection, expansion, simulation) already produces informative heuristics (e.g., distance‑based rewards, dead‑lock pruning). The only bottleneck is the loss of that information during back‑propagation. A modest rescaling therefore offers the biggest immediate gain without discarding the solid work already done.

    restructure). Do NOT add unrelated features.
  - Fix bugs and performance issues. Improve clarity.
  - If the draft is correct and fast, output it UNCHANGED.

## Response

CRITIQUE:
- The solved‑bonus is currently discounted like any other reward, so deep solved leaves may still contribute only a tiny amount, contrary to the intention of giving a strong spike for solved states.
- Minor redundancy: the `if remaining < 0` check is unnecessary because `cur_depth` never exceeds `leaf_depth` during upward traversal.
- No upper‑bound clamping is applied, but with the new parameters overflow is unlikely; nevertheless adding a safeguard is cheap.

ACTION: modify

FUNCTION_NAME: default_backpropagation
DESCRIPTION: Ensure solved bonus is applied undiscouted to the root and clean up minor redundancies.
