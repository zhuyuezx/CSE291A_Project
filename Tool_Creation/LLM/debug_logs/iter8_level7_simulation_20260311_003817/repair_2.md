## Response

**ACTION:** modify  
**FILE_NAME:** simulation.py  
**FUNCTION_NAME:** default_simulation  
**DESCRIPTION:** Fixed `NameError` by providing a local BFS implementation, corrected usage of the public `GameState` API (`current_player()` instead of `.player`, method calls with parentheses), and ensured the heuristic logic works with the actual API.
